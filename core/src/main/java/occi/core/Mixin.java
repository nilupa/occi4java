/**
 * A type in the OCCI model. A core component of the OCCI classification system.
 * The Mixin type complements the Kind type in defining the OCCI Core Model type
 * classification system. The Mixin type represent an extension mechanism, which
 * allow new resource capabilities to be added to resource instances both at
 * creation-time and/or run-time. A Mixin instance can be associated with any
 * existing resource instance and thereby add new resource capabilities, i.e.
 * attributes and Actions, to the resource instance. However, a Mixin can never
 * be applied to a type. In the initial instantiation of the OCCI Core Model,
 * with no extensions, no Mixin instances are present. [T. Metsch, A. Edmonds,
 * R. Nyren and A.Papaspyrou - Open Cloud Computing Interface - Core,
